# AR Construction Visualization Tool

## Description

An innovative mobile application that revolutionizes the construction industry by integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies. The app enables immersive 3D model visualization and enhanced collaboration among architects, builders, and stakeholders.
Developed using Unity 3D, Vuforia SDK, this tool simplifies construction processes, reduces costs, and improves decision-making.

### ARKTECHT APK INSTALLATION

   - Download and install the .Apk file provided in the repo.

**NOTE** (without the below Mobile requirements, app wont install and run properly)

   - Minimum supported Android API Level 28 (Android Pie 9.0).
   
   - Andorid Phone must have ARCORE support by GOOGLE, use this [Link](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices) to check if your device is supported.
     

### How to Use

1. **Prepare the Marker Images**: 
   - Download the marker images from the repository.
   - You can either print these images or display them on a mobile or laptop screen.

2. **Scan the Marker Images**: 
   - Use the auto-detect feature to identify which blueprint corresponds to which 3D building model.
   
3. **Identify the Building**: 
   - Once identified, select the specific building and scan its corresponding blueprint.

4. **Activate AR Portal**: 
   - Click on the ARPORTAL button.
   - Steadily scan the wide, spacious ground.
   - When a square marker appears on the screen, click on it.

5. **Experience the Virtual Building**: 
   - A large virtual building will be displayed on the ground.
   - Take a walk through it and enjoy the immersive experience!

## Technologies Used

- **Unity 3D Game Engine:** For creating and deploying 3D content.
- **AR Development SDK (Vuforia):** For integrating AR capabilities.
